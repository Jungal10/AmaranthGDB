#### Amaranth Description
Amaranth is an under-utilized crop that has been cultivated for its grains as pseudo-cereal and for its edible leaves as a vegetable.
In recent years, Amaranth regained importance because of its gluten-free nature, high nutritional value and good stress resilience
Grain amaranth is a pseudo-cereal from the Americas that has been domesticated three times independently from a single ancestor, making it an ideal system to study repeated evolution.
AmaranthGDB intends to provide useful resources and tools to interdisciplinary  amaranth research. We provide the first amaramth population genetics genome browser, **PopAmaranth** (link to PopAmaranth).
PopAmaranth facilitates browsing nine different summary statistics on genetic variation and selection signals, gene annotation and variant calls of the three grain amaranths and two wild relatives along the amaranth genome.

## About

In the last years, amaranth research has reached multiple essential milestones, including a high-quality reference genome, the reconstruction of its domestication history, and genome-wide genotyping data for hundreds of individuals.

Here, we present PopAmaranth, a population genetic genome browser, which provides an accessible representation of the genetic variation of the three grain amaranth species (A. hypochondriacus,A.cruentus, andA. caudatus) and two wild relatives (A. hybridus and A. quitensis) along the A. hypochondriacus reference sequence.
