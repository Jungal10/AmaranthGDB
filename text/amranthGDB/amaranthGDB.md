<!-- The 1001 Genomes Plus Vision
The 1001 Genomes Project was launched at the beginning of 2008 to discover detailed whole-genome sequence variation in at least 1001 strains (accessions) of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The first major phase of the project was completed in 2016, with publication of a detailed analysis of 1135 genomes. Unfortunately, the second-generation sequencing methods that have made it economically feasible to screen large numbers of individuals do not actually produce complete genome sequences â€” they produce massive numbers of very short sequence fragments that must be aligned to a reference genome in order to identify variants. Because of this, only simple variants are reported, and the results are invariably biased with respect to what is present or missing in the reference genome. Large or complex structural variants, as well as simple variants inside complex variants are generally missed completely. To remedy this problem, we have recently begun the second major phase, the 1001G+ project. We have begun to assemble genomes from a diverse collection of A. thaliana strains, with the goal of annotating them with transcriptome and epigenome information, and to develop tools to make the results available to the community. -->

The PGSB plant genomics group focuses on the analysis of plant genomes, using bioinformatic techniques. To store and manage the data, we developed a database, PlantsDB, that aims to provide a data and information resource for individual plant species. In addition PlantsDB provides a platform for integrative and comparative plant genome research.



 The internationally-recognized Wheat Genetics Resource Center is located at Kansas State University, in the heart of the Great Plains of the United States, one of the greatest wheat-growing regions in the world. Germplasm and the scientific method of breeding provide the foundation for bountiful wheat harvests.

The WGRC has three main missions to assure future advances in wheat breeding:

Collect, conserve, and utilize germplasm in crop improvement for sustainable production by broadening the crop genetic base,
Create and promote the free exchange of materials, technology, and new knowledge in genetics and biotechnology among the world's public and private organizations, and
Sponsor graduate and postgraduate students and visiting scientists for academic training and advanced research in the WGRC laboratories.
The WGRC maintains a gene bank, along with evaluation and passport data, on 2,500 wheat species accessions. In addition, the WGRC houses 2,200 cytogenetic stocks, the genetic treasures produced by a lifetinme of work by wheat scientists.
The WGRC has established a national and international network to conduct and coordinate genetic studies in wheat. Genes for host-plant resistance to viral, bacterial, fungal, and insect pests and abiotic stresses are identified, transferred to agronomically useful breeding lines, and deployed. The genetic bases of physiological, quality, and yield traits are studied. Chromosome and genetic maps of wheat and other Triticeae genera are developed. Biotechnological research emphasizes diagnostic assays, gene cloning, and plant transformation.

State-of-the-art laboratories, greenhouses, and field plot facilities are available for teaching and research. -->

#### Amaranth Description
Amaranth is an under-utilized crop that has been cultivated for its grains as pseudo-cereal and for its edible leaves as a vegetable.
In recent years, Amaranth regained importance because of its gluten-free nature, high nutritional value and good stress resilience
Grain amaranth is a pseudo-cereal from the Americas that has been domesticated three times independently from a single ancestor, making it an ideal system to study repeated evolution.

## About

In the last years, amaranth research has reached multiple essential milestones, including a high-quality reference genome, the reconstruction of its domestication history, and genome-wide genotyping data for hundreds of individuals.

Here, we present PopAmaranth, a population genetic genome browser, which provides an accessible representation of the genetic variation of the three grain amaranth species (A. hypochondriacus,A.cruentus, andA. caudatus) and two wild relatives (A. hybridus and A. quitensis) along the A. hypochondriacus reference sequence.
