Combo track selection
 A combo track selection/deselection is available for each category on the hierarchical track selector on the left.
 On the track selector, a search bar is available for a quick track search. For a cleaner view, full screen is accessible from the top right and grid lines can be untoggle for a clear background. Tracks height is also adjustable from the View drop-down menu. On the track label, the description for each track is available from the "About this track".
%\subsection{Final remarks/Overview}
%Climate changes and demographic expansion requires new solutions for human consumption and cattle feeding. For many years overlooked, minor crops rise now into the highlight as natural solutions for these demands, offering diversity and climate adapted species to developing regions strongly affected by these changes. To increase the knowledge about minor crops, high-throughput research methods have been applied generating a growing amount of data. More than making the data available, it is important to make it accessible and comprehensible for multiple fields of the scientific community.
%Genome browsers are important tools for studying genomes given the vast amounts of data available. PopAmaranth focuses on providing the resources to perform relatively simple, yet important, analysis. The observations will support experiments design and save considerable time to researchers in the various fields of knowledge. Having a multi population analysis allows detect recent signals present in a single population or older selection signals shared by related populations.
%Finding evidences/signals may allow to pinpoint the interest region/gene. Have more trust on results. Confirm experiments
%This type of observations are specially interesting in evolutionary biology, particularly on domestication studies. While limited to five species relative to a unique dataset, the deep intra and inter species analysis and the high-quality reference genome allow to offer researchers a more comprehensive multi-omics analysis. We intend to continuously extend PopAmaranth resources and metrics, keeping it a valuable asset for the community.
